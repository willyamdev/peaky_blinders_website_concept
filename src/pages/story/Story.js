          The hard economic difficulties experienced in England, during the second half of the 19th century, led to the manifestation of a subculture of violence in the younger sections of the population. During the 1890s, the poorest young people, mostly from large families or even orphans, to survive life on the streets or in the slums of large British cities, resorted to the practices of begging, theft and acts of pickpockets, often executed through aggression, beatings, stabbing and even strangulation. Many joined the countless street gangs, whose members' ages generally consisted of between twelve and thirty years of age, and followed a simple hierarchy, oscillating with the entry and exit of new elements.

          In the 1890s, one of the most violent street gangs in Birmingham, stood out a unique group known as "Peaky Blinders", being the most powerful and influential member of this group Kevin Mooney. His real name was Thomas Gilbert; however, he changed his name routinely, using other identities. Many of the group's land acquisitions were initiated by the group.

          It is speculated that they were founded by Thomas "Mucklow" Gilbert, in Small Heath, in one of the poorest slums in the district, as suggested by a newspaper article entitled "An outrageous murder at Small Heath, skull of a fractured man" (printed on Monday, March 24, 1890, edition of The Birmingham Mail), this article being the oldest evidence of the existence of the organized crime group. In the article referred to, the attack on George Eastwood, a young man, who died, victim of the damage caused by several men, is reported after a lynching performed outside a local pub.

          Its first activities revolved mainly around the occupation of favorable lands, mainly in the small communities of Small Heath and Cheapside of Birmingham. Its expansion was quickly noticed by its first rival gang, the "Cheapside Sloggers". Also called simply "Sloggers", this group originated in 1870 and were known for street fights or feuds in the Bordesley and Small Heath areas, in addition to the unique signatures of attacking their victims on the head with their belt buckles and use stones as a throwing weapon against owners who refused to pay for their protection. For months, the Peaky Blinders fought against them in an unreasonable effort to control dominance on earth.
